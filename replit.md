# Coding Challenges Collection

## Overview
This is a collection of coding challenge exercises implemented in both JavaScript and Python. The project includes algorithmic problems and data structures exercises.

## Project Structure

### JavaScript Files
- **yeehaw.js** - FizzBuzz-style challenge (multiples of 3 = "yee", multiples of 4 = "haw", multiples of both = "yeehaw")
- **pandigit.js** - Checks if a number contains all digits 0-9 at least once
- **items.js** - Class structure for to-do list items (incomplete)
- **todo.js** - To-do list implementation (incomplete, has syntax errors)

### Python Files
- **yeehaw.py** - Python implementation of the yeehaw challenge
- **pandigit.py** - Python implementation (incomplete)

### Data Files
- **NYSE/** - Contains stock market data (fundamentals, prices, securities)

## Current Workflow
The "Run Coding Challenges" workflow executes `yeehaw.js`, which demonstrates a complete working example with test cases.

## Recent Changes
- **October 28, 2025**: Initial Replit setup
  - Installed Node.js 20 and Python 3.11
  - Created workflow to run yeehaw.js
  - Added .gitignore for Python and Node.js

## Running the Code
- Click the **Run** button to execute yeehaw.js
- To run other files manually:
  - JavaScript: `node <filename>.js`
  - Python: `python <filename>.py`

## Notes
- Some files (todo.js, items.js, pandigit.py) are incomplete or have syntax errors
- The yeehaw and pandigit JavaScript implementations are fully functional
